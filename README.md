# 2-Portfolio

## Description
The purpose of this Challenge-2 was to create a personal portfolio that I can later refer to and update as I further my coding career. My portfolio is very blue. Blue happens to be my favorite color, so I thought it would be an understandable idea to include it. I grabbed work images from a public site called Nicepage. I decided to create my portfolio using a grid system for easing organization on the website. Thanks to this I got a better understanding of css and how important it is to take your time while styling a website.
